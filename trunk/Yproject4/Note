Notes
	addd a coherance pause signal that tells the coherance pause to wait until write cycel is finished.
		- Coherance wait for 1 cycle for answer/to be told to wait.
					- cMemHit <= '1' means wait for write to memory
					- cMemPause <= '1' means wait for cpu to finish,.
	dcachebusy = '1' when servicing coherance	
					
					
Coherance state conditions should not interrupt the CPU. 
		- if need to snoop and there is a snoop already asserted service that???
		- cache smell other will be a state where just remains until a proceed gets asserted from dcache
				- both cache's in this state what to do??


Bug notesx
		change AddrInt to AddrInt and nextAddrInt but on default the values given be state controlled 
				so that the update of valid and next bits can be done mid program run
		so when pause ='0' and write that means handling cache
		rtnSTATE issues: if rtnState is set already problem
		
		cMemAddr in Addr based on chrwork??
		Dcache snoops aren't dependent on MemWait from toplevel
		local tagarray update on idle after chkhit
		aMemWait doesn't stop chrwork
